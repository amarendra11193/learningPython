# learningPython
codes I will write to learn Python from beginner level to intermediate level.

<b>Here is the plan details:</b>

Day 1-5: Introduction and Basics
1. Create a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. Write a program that prompts the user for their name and then greets them.
3. Create a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
4. Write a program that takes a user's input and converts it from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa.
5. Use Python's built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries, and tuples) to manipulate and analyze data.

Day 6-10: File Handling and Web Scraping

6. Write a program that reads a text file and counts the number of occurrences of each word.
7. Use Python's requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape data from a website.
8. Create a program that downloads and saves a file from the internet using the requests library.
9. Write a program that searches for a keyword in multiple text files and returns the file names and line numbers where the keyword was found.
10. Use the pandas library to read and manipulate data from CSV and Excel files.

Day 11-15: Object-Oriented Programming and GUI Development

11. Create a class hierarchy to represent a real-world scenario (e.g. vehicles or animals).
12. Build a GUI program using the tkinter library to display data and respond to user inputs.
13. Write a program that reads and parses data from an XML file using the xml library.
14. Use the Pygame library to build a simple game (e.g. a maze or platformer).
15. Build a program that interacts with a SQLite database using Python's sqlite3 module.

Day 16-20: Web Development and APIs

16. Use Flask to build a simple web application that displays data from a database.
17. Build a program that interacts with a RESTful API using the requests library.
18. Use Django to build a full-stack web application (e.g. a blog or e-commerce site).
19. Create a program that uses the Twitter API to search for and analyze tweets.
20. Build a program that uses the Google Maps API to display maps and geolocation data.

Day 21-25: Data Science and Machine Learning

21. Use NumPy and Pandas to analyze and manipulate data from a CSV or Excel file.
22. Use Scikit-learn to build a simple machine learning model (e.g. a linear regression or decision tree).
23. Build a program that uses the OpenCV library to perform computer vision tasks (e.g. object detection or face recognition).
24. Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations of data and machine learning models.
25. Use TensorFlow or PyTorch to build and train a neural network for a machine learning task.

Day 26-30: Networking and Security

26. Write a program that uses the socket library to implement a simple client-server model.
27. Use the Scapy library to analyze and manipulate network traffic.
28. Build a program that interacts with a database using Python's SQLAlchemy library.
29. Create a program that encrypts and decrypts data using Python's cryptography library.
30. Use Python's built-in modules (e.g. os, subprocess, and sys) to perform system administration tasks (e.g. managing processes and files).
