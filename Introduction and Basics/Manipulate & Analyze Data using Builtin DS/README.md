#manipulate&AnalyzeDataUsingBuiltinDS
Programs I will create to learn and understand the builtin Data Structure

<b>Here is the Plan:</b>
1. Find the largest number in a list of numbers using a `for` loop.
2. Count the number of occurrences of a specific element in a list using a `for` loop.
3. Create a dictionary that maps the names of fruits to their prices, and then calculate the total cost of a shopping list.
4. Use a list comprehension to filter out all even numbers from a list of numbers.
5. Use a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary that maps the lengths of words in a sentence to the words themselves.
6. Sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key value.
7. Create a tuple of numbers and find the sum and product of all the numbers.
8. Use the `zip` function to create a dictionary from two lists, where one list contains keys and the other list contains values.
9. Convert a list of strings to a single string by concatenating them together with a specific separator.
10. Use nested lists and loops to create a multiplication table.
